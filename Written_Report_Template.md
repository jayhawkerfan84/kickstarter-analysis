# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

       The purpose of the project was to evaluate two subsets of data within the kick starter dataset. I needed to
       
     visualize outcomes by year for the subcategory “theater”. The second piece was the break down the percentage of 
     
     successful, failed and canceled campaigns from the subcategory “plays”. 


### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

    I was able to do my analysis by creating two charts to visualize the data requested. I found it hard to come to a
    
     conclusions just because of the lack of context or domain knowledge around the dataset. I think I would need to
     
     spend some more time reviewing the background and dataset to come up with some better conclusions. I found
     
     myself asking more questions, which is probably the point of the exercise. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


    Reviewing the data I saw that the summer months had far more successes. Which got me to thinking, does weather
    
     impact success? But if you look at the percentage of successful campaigns for each vintage there is not a wide 
     
     range in outcomes, best month is May with 66% and Dec with worst month with 49%. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


    What stands out to me with this dataset is that the smaller dollar goals performed the best. The large dollar
    
     goals did not perform too poorly given the ambitious goals. It would be interesting to get the demographic data 
     
     from the people who pledged. Would we be able to find the ideal pledger for each goal range that might lead to 
     
     better success. 

    
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


    I could not get the chart to sort correctly. I googled search, played around with the sort settings and nothing 
    
    worked. Any insight would be helpful. Other then that I felt very comfortable doing the work. While I do not 
    
    have a lot of experience with excel, I do have a lot of experience with SQL therefore using functions is not new 
    
    to me. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    The successful campaigns had a high range of spread than failed or canceled. If we had further data we might be 
    
    able to dig into that a little deeper. For example, May, June, July start dates had the most success, why is 
    
    that? It’s hard to come to a conclusion with the current given dataset.

    Secondly, the launch date did not seem to impact the failed campaigns. In fact when theater campaigns saw the 
    
    highest successes, they also saw the highest of failures. Maybe there is an opportunity to optimize how many 
    
    theather campaigns are running at the same time to get better outcomes. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    It is difficult to have successful campaign with a high dollar goal. Is it worth having such goals when there is

    such a high success rate at the 0-9999 goal range?


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Who are the people that are pledging? I think having the data on the pledgers could give insight on how to have 

    a successful campaign. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    I think it would be interesting to see if there is a relationship between the staff pick and the success of the 
    
    campaign.
