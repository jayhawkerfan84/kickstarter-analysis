# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

       The purpose of the project was to evaluate two subsets of data within the kick starter dataset. I needed to visualize outcomes by year for the subcategory “theater”. The second piece was the break down the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns from the subcategory “plays”. 

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

    I was able to do my analysis by creating two charts to visualize the data requested, which can be found [here](https://github.com/jayhawkerfan84/kickstarter-analysis/tree/main/resource). I found it hard to come o some conclusions just because of the lack of context or domain knowledge around the dataset. I think I would need to spend some more time reviewing the background and dataset to come up with some better conclusions. I found myself asking more questions, which is probably the point of the exercise. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

    Reviewing the data I saw that the summer months had far more successes. Which got me to thinking, does weather impact success? But if you look at the percentage of successful campaigns for each vintage there is not a wide range in outcomes, best month is May with 66% and Dec with worst month with 49%. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

    What stands out to me with this dataset is that the smaller dollar goals performed the best. The large dollar goals did not perform too poorly given the ambitious goals. It would be interesting to get the demographic data from the people who pledged. Would we be able to find the ideal pledger for each goal range that might lead to better success. 
    
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

    I could not get the chart to sort correctly. I googled search, played around with the sort settings and nothing worked. Any insight would be helpful. Other then that I felt very comfortable doing the work. While I do not have a lot of experience with excel, I do have a lot of experience with SQL therefore using functions is not new to me. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    The successful campaigns had a high range of spread than failed or canceled. If we had further data we might be able to dig into that a little deeper. For example, May, June, July start dates had the most success, why is that? It’s hard to come to a conclusion with the current given dataset.

    Secondly, the launch date did not seem to impact the failed campaigns. In fact when theater campaigns saw the highest successes, they also saw the highest of failures. Maybe there is an opportunity to optimize how many theather campaigns are running at the same time to get better outcomes. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Some attributes do not provide much insight. For example, what is the signficance of the staff pick

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
